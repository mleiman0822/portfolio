      I was born in a town called Sunrise, Florida. I moved to Las Vegas when I was in my teens and spent most of my working career in Mobile Applications/Mobile Gaming and Digital Marketing. I moved to Fargo in August of 2020 to 
      attend Emerging Digital Academy and to start fresh in a new place. I have a hunger for learning and expanding my knowledge of anything tech related. As a result, I have found myself learning a lot of new skills on this journey. I look forward
      to what the future holds.
